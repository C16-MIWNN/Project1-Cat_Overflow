Cooking recipes project

Base idea:
A recipe website where you an add, edit, delete and look at recipes.



On the main page you can look at list of recipes with a picture and description or add new recipes.

When you select a recipe, you are redirected to the recipe detail page, which will show an overview of the following items:
- recipe name
- description
- picture (of food)
- ingredients 
- preparation method
- preparation time
- portions (example: servings, food items)
- cooking method (example: grill, roast, bake, boil)
- meal (breakfast, lunch, diner)
- dish (example: bread, fish, soup, pasta)
- kitchen (country of origin)
- edit recipe button
- delete recipe button



Questions for first meeting:
- What are the minimal requirements for the application?
- Should the users be able to log in?
- What are the authorisation rules for the users? (edit, remove recipe)
- How many users should be allowed?
- If multiple users, should recipes have the option to be private.
- How often would you like an update?

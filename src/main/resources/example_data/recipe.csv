Beef Stew in Red Wine Sauce,"This cozy dish, reminiscent of beef bourguignon, was a specialty of Jacques Pépin's mother.","Jeannette Pépin, Jacques Pépin's mother, served this red wine–beef stew at her Lyon restaurant, Le Pélican, where she would cook tougher cuts of meat into a rich, luscious, comforting dish.

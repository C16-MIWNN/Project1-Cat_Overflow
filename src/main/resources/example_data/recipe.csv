Beef Stew in Red Wine Sauce,"This cozy dish, reminiscent of beef bourguignon, was a specialty of Jacques Pépin's mother.","Jeannette Pépin, Jacques Pépin's mother, served this red wine–beef stew at her Lyon restaurant, Le Pélican, where she would cook tougher cuts of meat into a rich, luscious, comforting dish. The recipe doesn't use stock, demi-glace, or even water, relying on robust red wine to create the deeply flavored braising sauce. The finished dish is a celebration of cozy, comforting French fare — and always a hit with Pépin's chef friends.",4,servings,160,10,"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16","1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9"
